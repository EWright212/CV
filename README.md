## Emily Wright

I am a junior software developer with a passion for learning. I recently graduated from Makers academy bootcamp where I was able to start learning about agile web app mdevelopment. Prior to makers, I was a qualified accountant in audit at EY working with clients from the banking and capital markets industry.

## Skills

#### Clean Coder

Makers (January to April 2019) During my time at Makers I learned about the importance of having an efficient and a readable codebase. Throughout the course I utilised programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practiced using XP Values in group situations to ensure everyone was on the same wavelength, and used TDD/BDD to lower the risk of introducing bugs and to improve my understanding and intentions behind how project was to work. 

I truly believe in this approach to software development and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.

#### Communication and Teamwork

Makers (January to April 2019) At Makers I had the opportunity to work with a very diverse group of people. I paired with someone new every day, which meant that between completing features I would often have to ramp up my new pair on what we were trying to achieve, as well as what had been done so far. This has allowed me to hone my ability to communicate complex ideas in a concise way.

Group projects were also a regular occurence and we organised our own stand-ups and retros to ensure the team had effective communication. Good communcation is imperative for an agile team to respond to changing environments; if you can communicate, you can do anything!

#### Problem Solving

EY (2016 - 2019)
Throughout my time here, as a senior in charge of overseeing the team's audit work, I developed my ability to troubleshoot problems. With each project i worked on I carried out, I gained more experience with how to approach problems; I became better at asking specific questions when something wasn't working, I learnt when and how to ask for help, and was able to recognise when solutions I came up with in the past would work again. I was also able to adapt knowldge from many sources such as online, past work, asking questions of the client, and colleagues to solve issues.  I learnt how to delegate
